                    Focusing is essential to getting things done and even more
                    so for learning. But our focus depends on a lot of variables
                    and is affected by a huge variety of events. It depends on
                    how we slept, the time of day, what we ate, our emotional
                    state, our stress level, our energy level, and the list goes
                    on and on. Focusing and keeping your focus can be difficult.

                <div class="article__section__text">
                    But one tool that helps me consistently to focus every day
                    is a simple timer.
                </div>
                <div class="article__section__text">
                    A simple timer that is built around three main principles:
                    1) visual and intentional timeboxing, 2) the idea of your
                    focus being flexible, and 3) taking time to rest.

                    1) visual and intentional timeboxing
                </div>
                <div class="article__section__text">
                    I don’t block time in my calendar and start working blindly
                    without a sense of time. Instead, I just like to use a
                    visual timer.
                </div>
                <div class="article__section__text">
                    I start by making it intentional. I define what I want to
                    do, why I want to do it, and for how long I want to do it. I
                    set the time, remove almost all distractions and start
                    focusing.
                </div>
                <div class="article__section__text">
                    Defining and seeing the timer helps me in a lot of ways. It
                    helps me commit to being focused. It gives me a sense of
                    responsibility. It creates constraints to thinking. Once the
                    time is up, it acts as a threshold to quickly reflect if I
                    can focus for longer or if I have to take a break.
                    Additionally, if my attention drifts while focusing, it
                    serves as a reminder to draw my attention back again.
                </div>
                <div class="article__section__text">
                    The drifting attention is quite normal and therefore part of
                    the second main principle.

                </div>
                <div class="article__section__text">
                    Our ability to focus is not an on-off switch. Our focus is
                    dynamic and flexible. It oscillates and the intensity of our
                    focus can change over time. Therefore, it is normal that our
                    attention randomly starts to drift while we are trying to
                    focus on what is in front of us.
                </div>
                <div class="article__section__text">
                    It happens to me all the time.

                    The important thing is to gently bring back your attention.
                </div>
                <div class="article__section__text">
                    The methods I usually use to bring back my attention are
                    looking at my timer, trying to focus visually on a small
                    area, or deliberately taking micro-breaks.
                </div>
                <div class="article__section__text">
                    Seeing the timer and the time just refreshes my intentions
                    and helps me redirect my attention.
                </div>
                <div class="article__section__text">
                    Focusing visually is a method I learnt from the Huberman Lab
                    Podcast. Our mental focus follows our visual focus. If we
                    focus visually on a small area for a few seconds or minutes,
                    our mental focus will also follow. Our mental focus will
                    start to sharpen itself.
                </div>
                <div class="article__section__text">
                    If my attention drifts, I also like to take a micro-break
                    from time to time. I close my eyes or look away. I don’t do
                    anything. I just pause for a few seconds, focus on my
                    breathing and focus back afterwards.
                </div>
                <div class="article__section__text">
                    But sometimes it is just too difficult to draw back your
                    attention or keep focusing after the timer is up. That’s why
                    we also have to take real breaks. Take these breaks at least
                    after every 90 minutes of focusing.

                    3) take time to rest
                </div>
                <div class="article__section__text">
                    One important part of focusing that is often overlooked is
                    taking real breaks. We have to rest. Focusing is difficult,
                    it drains our energy and resting helps us recharge.
                </div>
                <div class="article__section__text">
                    If we recharge properly, we might be able to focus again
                    later. But be careful. Still sitting in front of your laptop
                    and watching YouTube videos will not cut it. It is not true
                    resting and you won’t recharge energy. It will have the
                    opposite effect. You will just drain more energy and reduce
                    the chance of focusing later.
                </div>
                <div class="article__section__text">
                    So take a proper break. Stand up. Stretch. Go around or even
                    go for a short walk.
                </div>
                <div class="article__section__text">
                    But how long should your break be?

                <div class="article__section__text">
                    It depends on how long you focused before.
                </div>
                <div class="article__section__text">
                    I like to set my initial timer to 52 minutes because I’m
                    used to using the 52/17 method. If my focus feels off, I
                    stop before the 52 minutes. Most of the time I focus fully
                    for 52 minutes. And sometimes I go beyond the 52 minutes.
                </div>
                <div class="article__section__text">
                    Depending on the time I focused, I take a break and rest for
                    approximately 1/3 of the focused time. So, if I focused for
                    52 minutes, I take a 17-minute break.

                <div class="article__section__text">
                    Here is a quick step-by-step example of how I approach
                    focusing:
                </div>
                <div class="article__section__list">
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Define what I want to do, why I want to do it and
                            for how long I want to do it.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Set a timer. As mentioned before, I like to start
                            with 52 minutes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Start focusing.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If my attention drifts, draw back my attention by
                            checking my timer, focusing visually, or taking a
                            micro-break.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If it is too difficult to draw the attention back,
                            take a real break of 1/3 of the focused time up
                            until now.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If the timer is up, reflect and decide if I can
                            focus for longer or need a break.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If I can focus for longer, I will keep focusing for
                            as long as I can but I will take a break at around
                            90 minutes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Take a break for 1/3 of the focused time.
                        </li>

                <div class="article__section__text">
                    These steps help me embrace how focusing actually works.
                    Instead of following a fixed timer or no timer at all, I
                    follow my ability to focus within the constraints I created
                    before.
